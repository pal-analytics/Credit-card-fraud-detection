# Credit-card-fraud-detection
I have analyzed Credit card detection using, Python, ML models, SQL and Power bi
This project analyzes credit card transactions to identify fraud patterns using **SQL**, **Python (Pandas + ML)**, and **Power BI**.  
It covers the full workflow: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model building, and dashboard visualization for insights.

> Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major challenge for banks and fintech companies.
This project demonstrates a real-world workflow:

- Data Extraction & EDA (SQL + Python)
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
- Building two ML models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
- Evaluating performance using confusion matrix & accuracy/recall
- Visualizing insights in Power BI

---

> Dataset Information

The dataset contains anonymized transactions with PCA-transformed features. Key details:

Time – Seconds elapsed between each transaction
V1 to V28 – PCA-transformed anonymized features
Amount – Transaction value
Class –
0 = Non-fraud
1 = Fraud
Total Rows: 284,807
Fraud Rows: 492

> Tools & Techniques

SQL (Oracle SQL)
-Used for data extraction, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis
-Executed aggregate functions, grouping, filtering, and time-based analysis
-Performed fraud vs non-fraud segmentation and transaction pattern exploration

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)

-Data loading and preprocessing
-Exploratory data analysis and imbalance handling (SMOTE)
-Built Logistic Regression & Random Forest models
-Evaluated models using accuracy, recall, and confusion matrix
-Exported processed dataset to CSV for Power BI

Power BI

-Created dashboard for fraud insights and model interpretation
-Built KPIs, bar charts, confusion matrix, and amount distributions
-Designed clean one-page layout with dark theme
